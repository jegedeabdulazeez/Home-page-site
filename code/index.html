             <p>Zuma Rock
                Lets start with the most iconic, Zuma Rock, also known as the “Gateway to Abuja.” You cant miss it. This massive natural monolith stands tall along the Abuja–Kaduna expressway, and from certain angles, it looks like theres a human face carved into it. Creepy? Maybe. Impressive? Definitely. While climbing is not officially allowed, you can take stunning photos, enjoy a picnic nearby, and hear interesting local myths about the rocks “powers.”
                Tip: Visit at sunset. The way the light hits the rock is magical. </p>
